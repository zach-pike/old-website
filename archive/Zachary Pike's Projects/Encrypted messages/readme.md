This is the readme file for my encryptor program

its farily easy to use, you get a pair of prime numbers and put it into the key generator.html webpage file (if it says invalid keys try picking new prime numbers)
Steps:
Step 1: pick some prime numbers 
Step 2: calculate the keys
Step 3: put the keys into the encrypt.html webpage file
Step 4: type your message
Step 5: click encrypt 
Step 6: you are done!

To decrypt:
same as Step 1-3 except it has to be the same key st the keys that were used to encrypt the message
Step 4 enter your encrypted message click decrypt and boom you should get text out
